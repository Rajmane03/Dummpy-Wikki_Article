    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> <i style="font-size: 27px;">W</i>eb developer's job is to create websites. While their
      primary role is to ensure the website is visually appealing
      and easy to navigate, many web developers are also responsible for the website's performance and capacity.The
      applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js,
      Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web developer may specialize in
      client-side applications (front-end developer), server-side applications (back-end developer), or
      both (full-stack developer). A web content management system may be used to develop and maintain web applications.

    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> What is a simple reason why Web Developer is such a hot job right now. Put simply, what
      Web Developers do is create how we
      experience â€¦ the web. If you proceed from the nation that every person who engages with the web would prefer a
      great experience,
      then you can say that everyone who engages with the web would prefer that a Web Developer have done a great job.
      Companies of course
      know this, so they hire Web Developers to ensure their sites provide great experiences. So, lots of websites and
      lots of users
      means lots of demand. LOTS of Demand!!!.<br><br>We have just entered year 2016 and its already a couple of days
      old. Just before New Years Eve, I showed you our take on the year 2015 in web development. Now its time to take a
      look at the new year.
      With upcoming frameworks, powerful development tools and evolving technologies, this year looks very promising for
      web developers.Here are our thoughts on the top web development trends
      for 2016.<br><br> <i><u>Full-screen navigation design</u></i><br>Full-screen navigation design is a feature that
      improves the user experience on mobile devices. Lets say a user is navigating a website on his mobile phone and he
      comes across a registration form.
      As he taps on the registration form, the form jumps to a full-screen size enabling the user to fill out the form
      in a more natural way.More and more web developers and designers are developing sites for full-screen navigation
      designs
      and this trend is going to continue.<br><br> <i><u>Blocking of advetisements on sites </u></i><br>Across the
      world, website owners are losing money to advertisement-blocking plugins. In one year alone, UK ad blocking grew
      by 82% and reached 12 million active users. This affected the earnings of not only the smaller sites that depend
      on advertising revenues but also the big media publishers.
      In 2016, websites will do their best to minimize the effect of ad blocking. A number of techniques will emerge
      that will neglect the effect of ad-blocking plugins. You can also expect the sites to come up with innovative and
      persuasive ways of showing advertisements
      to their users. <br><br><i><u>There is a lot to come!</i></u><br>Looking at these web development trends and
      predictions one thing is clear. Web developers are out to make the process of website development easier and
      simpler. And that is good news.
      It is only when these developers save time from their day-to-day workflow, will they be able to focus on newer
      technologies that improve the user experience of web browsing.</p>
